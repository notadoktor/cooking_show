# Fennel-roasted cauliflower with quinoa

**SERVES** 4

**PREP** 15 mins

**COOK** 40 mins

## Ingredients

- 1 large #cauliflower, or 2 small ones, separated into florets
- 1 tbsp fennel seeds
- 1 tsp coriander seeds
- 1 tsp smoked paprika
- 2 tbsp olive oil
- 1 red onion, chopped
- 2 bell peppers (mix of red, yellow or orange), chopped
- 1 #courgette / #zucchini, halved lengthways, cored and chopped
- 1 small #garlic clove, crushed
- 1 lemon, juiced and zested
- 4 tbsp yogurt
- 250g #quinoa, cooked

## Steps

1. Heat the oven to 200C/180C fan/ gas 6. Bring a large pan of salted water to the boil and cook the cauliflower for
   5 mins. Drain and spread out on a surface so any excess water evaporates.
2. Crush the fennel and coriander seeds using a pestle and mortar and mix with the paprika and a pinch of seasoning.
   Put the cauliflower in a large bowl, drizzle with half the olive oil and sprinkle over the spice mix. Toss the
   florets to fully coat them.
3. Tip the florets onto a baking tray and space them apart. Put the red onions, peppers and courgettes on a separate
   baking tray, drizzle with the remaining oil, and cook both for 30-35 mins, turning halfway through so they brown
   all over and turn slightly crisp in places.
4. Mix the garlic with lemon juice and stir through the yogurt, adding a little extra water to loosen if needed. Stir
   the roasted onions, peppers and courgettes into the cooked quinoa along with the lemon zest and a pinch of salt.
5. Pile the quinoa salad onto a plate, then top with the cauliflower florets. Drizzle over the garlic yogurt.
