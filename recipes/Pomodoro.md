# Slow Cook Pomodoro and Booster Sauce

Quite simply one of the simplest and most amazing sauces you can put on pasta (or anything else). The key
ingredient is <s>thyme</s> time. A great way to spend a Sunday afternoon: hang out, drink some wine and
turn some plants into pure magic.

Original recipe: https://pastebin.com/1RbdnctG via: https://twitter.com/David_Rudnick/status/1301484217013014528

Cook time: at least 3.5h.

- 30-60 minutes for the first steps
- 3ish hours or As Long As It Takes for reducing and stirring

Go slow. Allow for more the first time you make it. Taste the back of the spoon with your finger often. Make as big a
batch as you feel comfortable with.

## Ingredients

Numbers are very fuzzy and not hugely important. Increase / decrease amount and/or size of tomatoes for the
amount of sauce you want to make.

_Pomodoro:_

- 8-12 large, ripe tomatoes, approx apple sized
- 1 large onion, medium diced
- salt
- olive oil
- balsamic vinegar

_Booster sauce:_

- 2-3 cloves garlic
- mayo, vegan or regular
- Lao Gan Ma sichuan salted black bean (or something similar)

### Picking the ingredients

In general, better ingredients will lead to better sauce. Use a nicer olive oil if you can, though don't go too nice.
The really high end olive oils are wasted on cooking and should be used where the flavor can show off more. Fine sea
salt is great if you have it, but standard table salt will also be okay.

#### Tomatoes

In some ways your limit is size of your pot. The better and riper these are the better the sauce will be. You can use
more or larger tomatoes if you wish. It will not hurt and you will get more sauce, but go very ripe, very red. You want
the tomatoes to squish a little when you touch them. If you buy tomatoes and they arent super ripe yet, leave them in a
bowl by the windowsil where they will get direct sunlight. Don't store fresh tomatoes in the fridge!

#### Onion

Original recipe called for white, I used yellow. Pretty sure most any onion type will do, though shallots may not do as
well with the long cooking time.

#### Booster sauce

There's a lot of flexibility here, and it really depends mostly on your personal taste. You want strong umami flavors,
which the Lao Gan Ma is glorious for. You could also use fresh chilis, sambal, parmesan, anchovies, basil, etc.

## Equipment

- 1 large stockpot, largest / tallest you have
- 1 or more large bowls
- blender / food processor

## Steps

### 1. Prep

Time: 10-15 minutes

1. Do about a medium dice on the onion, or fine if you like a smoother sauce texture
2. Cross the base of the tomatoes with a knife and add to a large pot of boiling water
3. Once the skins have started pucker, remove the tomatoes and blanch in an ice bath or other pot with cold water
   - stops the tomatoes from cooking and makes handling them easier
4. Peel the skins from the blanchd tomatoes, keeping as little flesh on the skins as possible, and set safely aside
   - These are _VERY_ important for the booster sauce, do not throw them away
5. Roughly dice the tomatoes and add them to a large bowl
   - Repeat steps 2-5 in batches as needed
6. Add a very generous dusting of salt to the surface of the tomatoes. Basically as if you frosting a cake with icing
   sugar
   - _Optional:_ stir tomatoes to mix and repeat, depending on surface area and salt preferences
   - You will (generally) use slightly more salt than you think is necessary. The capacity for salt to add flavour to
     tomatoes is huge and you are using a lot of tomatoes. Don't let it pile but cover all the surfaces
7. Add a splash of balsalmic vinegar to the tomatoes and stir to mix
   - Can also use red wine, prosecco, other vingegars, etc. This bit is to personal taste. It's absolutely fine to
     skip and go 100% Puro, but if you have an open bottle to hand throw a cup in.
8. Stir tomatoes and let sit during the next steps

### 2. Booster sauce, phase 1

Time: 30-60 minutes, depending amount of skins, oil temp, etc.

1. Take the large stockpot and cover the entire base with olive oil, to a depth of about 1cm
   - _Optional:_ I like to us a little bit of pepper infused oil to give some extra kick
2. Get that oil to a low to medium heat, so it's not quite bubbling
   - medium (5) to get the oil to temp, and medium-low (3-4) to maintain temp
3. Add the tomato skins you saved to the oil, ensuring they have enough room to spread out
   - The correct heat of the oil is when they rise to the surface and float, but you aren't quite frying them. They
     should be at most very lightly bubbling
   - _Note:_ We are separating the natural oils in the skin from the skin structure here, which provide the incredible
     colour and some of the flavor. This is one of my secrets to this long cook. By infusing the oil with flavour we are
     about to carry the tomato flavour into the aromatics, which means you get even more tomato depth.
4. Once the skins start to curl up like cigars and turn transparent, remove them from the oil and put in the blender
   - _Optional:_ squeeze the skins against a strainer to get some of absorbed oils back into the pot
5. Repeat as needed until all of the skins are in the blender. The oil should also be a noticeably more orange color now
6. Add the diced onion to the tomato-infused oil, stirring well
7. Turn heat to medium (5) and let cook for ~10 mins, until the onion has softened and begun to take on a light golden colour
   - ensure there is enough oil and stir to prevent the onion from burning or being actually "browned"

### 3. Booster sauce, phase 2

Time: ~10 mins

Do while the onions cook, but keep an eye on them to make sure they're not burning. If the onions are ready before the
booster sauce, switch to [the reduction steps](#4-pomodoro-time---the-reduction)

Much of this is to taste, so take amounts as guidelines rather than strict rules.

8. Add the crushed garlic gloves to the blender
   - _Note:_ this will not be cooked further, so keep in mind this is raw garlic
9. Add several tablespoons (~50ml) of Lao Gan Ma (or your umami bomb of choice) to the blender
   - _Optional:_ add some chili oil for kick
10. Add a few dollops of mayo to the blender (~2 tbsp, 30ml)
    - The goal here is to have _just enough_ oil/mayo for everything to blend smoothly. Mayo works better as a binder
      than straight oil, but use what you have.
11. Blend, taste and adjust flavors as desired. This is a concentrated bomb of flavor that you use to mix in with
    anything you want to make awesome. Add more mayo and use as an aioli, add a spoonful or two to a curry sauce,
    turn a jarred pasta sauce into a much better sauce (though not as good as this pomodoro!), or my favorite:
    just use it as a dip for chips / pita / etc.
12. Place final product in a jar or storage container. Will be good for ~4w (probably fine longer), but it usually
    gets eaten well before then

### 4. Pomodoro time - the reduction

Time: 3+ hours

This is a beautiful, calming, meditative process. Put a movie on on your laptop, pour yourself some wine, or put a
record on that you love. You are about to do nothing but gently simmer and taste a beautiful sauce that will simply
get better and better for the next 2 hours. So relax. This bit is as easy as it gets, and beautiful fun.

13. Add all the tomatoes you had salting in the bowl to the onions/oil in the pot, stir and bring to a _light_ simmer
    - I set the burner to 5 until the first bubble, then turn down to 4
    - _Note:_ You should have what looks like a salsa. Do not worry! Turn the heat up slightly but never, _ever,_ at
      any point in this recipe go more than a fraction above medium heat. As the volume of liquid in your pan reduces
      over the next steps, always bring the heat down slightly to compensate. This is the secret: the sugars in the
      tomatoes must never be exposed to a high enough heat that they are allowed to caramelise. This moment in the
      cooking process is irreversible: you never get deeper flavour after it as the structure has bonded.
14. Stir every 1-3 minutes, scraping any sauce on the sides of the pot back down
15. Adjust heat so that sauce is only lightly simmering
16. Repeat steps 14 and 15 until the sauce is ready, approx. 3h

The low, slow simmer will transform from that salsa to the most richly red, incorporated sauce over the course of
these next hours. Stir, scrape any residue that forms on the sides back into the sauce, and keep tasting the back of
the spoon after you stir to monitor the flavor development.

After about 1.5 hours the flavors really start accellerating. By the end it will simply get exponentially stronger.
Make sure the heat is adjusted gently downwards as the sauce gets drier and moisture evaporates, And, of course, stir
and taste every minute or two to make sure no solids stick to the base of pan or burn/caramelize. As long as the sauce
is gently steaming and bubbling, good things are happening. Go with as long as it takes.

You can also use lower heat, it will just take more time to reduce.

This is all you need. You will get there when you get there and simply stop when the sauce is maybe a tiny bit drier
than your preferred consistency. The sauce is strong and flavourful and so you should be able to take a large portion
of it and place it in a mason jar or other sealed container to keep in the fridge for the rest of the week, or freeze
it if you are in full prepper bossmode.

When serving you can add a spoon of the booster sauce back to a few big spoons of the main sauce and then you are
truly, as our friend Guy is wont to say, in FlavourTown.
